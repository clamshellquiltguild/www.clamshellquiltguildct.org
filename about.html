        <h2>About Clamshell Quilt Guild</h2>
	<h3 class="arial"><a name="history"></a>History</h3>
	<p>The Clamshell Quilt Guild was founded by a small group of women who 
were taking quilt lessons together at a local sewing machine store. As 
they sat over their sewing machines learning new quilt patterns, they 
talked about starting a new guild. There were other guilds in the area; 
however, several of the women felt a guild was needed in the New London,
 Waterford and East Lyme area. Subsequent to many hours of planning and 
pre-organization the first meeting of the Clamshell Quilt Guild was held
 on September 27, 1989. This first meeting attracted 75 interested 
quilters, a far greater number than anticipated.   
      </p><p>The membership has enjoyed continued growth in numbers with
 each passing year.  Regionally, our nearly 200 members encompass 
northern and southeastern Connecticut and southern Rhode Island.</p> 
      <p>The name Clamshell was selected to reflect the rich nautical 
history of an area graced with Long Island Sound&#8217;s miles of coastline. 
The befitting &#8216;Clamshell&#8217; quilt pattern inspired the guild&#8217;s logo.</p>
      <p>Since the inception of the Guild, the primary focus has been to
 promote and preserve the art of quilting.  Clamshell does this through 
its many and varied activities including conducting workshops, inviting 
award winning guest speakers to address our guild, organizing in-house 
demonstrations of the latest tools and techniques, and creating 
opportunities for its members to gather together several times a  month 
to quilt together.</p>
      <p>In its effort to give back to the community the Guild has 
evolved into a non-profit, charitable organization, supporting many 
other local not-for-profits. Therefore, volunteerism is highly regarded 
and promoted within our membership.</p>

	<h3 class="arial"><a name="meeting"></a>Monthly Meeting Format</h3>
	<p>Our evening begins with a social hour from 6:00-6:30PM, allowing members to socialize as well as visit the various committee tables such as Current Events, Program Information, Charity, Ways and Means, or Block of the Month. The meeting starts with a welcome to new members, followed by a planned program or the guest speaker.  The business part of the meeting consists primarily of committee reports and announcements. A short break in the middle of the meeting allows members to stretch their legs, visit the committee tables, purchase raffle tickets, sign up for workshops, visit the free table, or buy raffle tickets. This is followed by drawings for the door prize, the Ways and Means raffle, and Block of the Month. The meeting concludes on a high note with an opportunity for members to share their recent projects during Show and Tell.</p>

	<h3 class="arial"><a name="charity"></a>Charity Projects</h3>
	<p>Clamshell Quilt Guild gives to many charities either by contributing
 quilts made by members from donated fabric, by giving needed items to 
local non-profits, or by Guild financial donations. In the past two 
years significant monetary gifts were made to the New England Quilt 
Museum, the Women's Center of Southeastern CT, now Safe Futures), and 
Lawrence &amp; Memorial Hospital's "Look Good Feel Better" program.  
Through the Charity Quilt Committee, members made over 200 baby quilts 
per year for the Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit at L&amp;M, quilts for 
youth at the Waterford Country School, and bed size quilts for the New 
London HHC Veteran's Home in New London. Items are collected at every 
meeting for the Safe Futures (formerly Women's Center of SECT) as well 
as pillowcases and utility bags that are made by members and donated to 
the center.
